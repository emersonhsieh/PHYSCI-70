# Pallas Chou

Hi! I'm Pallas :) Thanks for stopping by!

I love sushi, science puns, and the Oxford comma. I concentrate in Chemical and
Physical Biology and have a secondary in Government. I enjoy understanding how
systems work--biological systems, political systems, you name it! I'm currently
doing research on how enzymes work together to make antibiotics. In my spare
time, I love watching sunrises with friends.

This website contains the work I will be doing in the course "Introduction to
Digital Fabrication." Come explore with me!
