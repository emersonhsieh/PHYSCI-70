      <h3>Week 1: Introduction</h3>

      <p>Going into this week, I had a couple of ideas.</p>
      <p>
        First idea: I'm super interested in toilets. For instance, researchers
        at Stanford have invented a toilet that can detect health markers based
        on disease markers. Moreover, there are lots of places that don't have
        access to comprehensive sewer systems. Hence, some researchers are
        working on creating self-containing toilets aka toilets that do not rely
        on external energy or water and can dispose waste by itself. I don't
        know what I would do entirely with this project except I do think
        toilets are very cool.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        Second idea: Lab equipment. Problem is, the thing I primarily work with
        are pipettes and I can't think of what else our lab would need. I don't
        think making an electronic pipette would be super satisfying though
        since electronic/robotic pipettes have already been made.
      </p>
      <p><img src="./pipette.jpg" alt="image of pipettes" /></p>

      <p>
        Talking to Nathan though, he mentioned that there are some researchers
        in MGH who might need help in creating something to model spinal cords.
        Hence, I would be interested in that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third idea: Having something that could create a model of proteins. I
        really like proteins and was imagining 3D printing amino acids and then
        having a machine that could link these amino acids into a linear peptide
        while modeling the release of water.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think this would be more feasible since peptide bond formation is a
        standard reaction i.e. I don't have a bajillion types of reactions going
        on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a
        <a
          href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/v/peptide-bond-formation"
          >Video describing peptide bond formation</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, I think I'm going to go with project idea number 2 (with the
        spinal cord MGH idea) since it's the most concrete and has a real-life
        impact. But if 2 doesn't work out, I'll most likely do 3.
