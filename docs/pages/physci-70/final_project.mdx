# Final Project: Detecting if the compost of your composting toilet is ready

Note that I had COVID and strep for the week leading up to the final project
symposium; the first day out of isolation was the day of the symposium :( Hence,
I'll also be covering some of my inNoVatIve TecHNIques during quarantine and
while being sick

## Background

Over 40% of the world does not have access to a flushing toilet. By
contaminating water, open defecation gives rise to a host of diseases including
diarrhea, intestinal worm infections, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and polio.
Moreover, there are a variety of social issues associated with a lack of toilets
within households. For instance, open defecation is not socially accepted for
females. This has severe implications. Women are chastised or beaten for openly
defecating in the public during the day. That means that from a productivity and
quality of life standpoint, those same women, because they don’t want to go to
the bathroom during the day, may drink less water or manage their diet in a way
so they don’t have to.

Furthermore, females who go to community toilets are often preyed upon.
Currently, there is a container system present in some areas. This bucket is
emptied by being brought to a fecal waste management facility; sometimes, these
facilities are very far away. One of the challenges is it fills up quickly and
the more often it fills up, the more they have to pay to have it emptied. In
addition, many community toilets are unclean and pay-per-use, which further
incentivizes open defecation.

This need for better sanitation has spurred a world-wide effort to brainstorm
and implement ways to make toilets more accessible. Some toilets are funded by
universities and governments. Others are funded by, at least in some part,
philanthropy organizations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation launched the
“Reinvent the Toilet Challenge” in 2011 and has had subsequent “Reinvent the
Toilet” fairs and expos, with the most recent one being in 2018. At these fairs
and expos, scientists show off their toilet designs for the chance to be further
funded by the foundation. To date, the foundation has committed more than 200
million dollars. These innovative toilet designs come in different forms,
including one that concentrates sunlight to disinfect waste and one that uses
ultrasound (sound waves) to remove air pockets from waste, allowing the waste to
be more compact. All are linked by a common thread: these toilets are not
connected to sewer, water, or electrical lines.

One of the innovative self-containing toilets is a composting toilet. There are
some different types of composting toilets. For instance, the Tiger Worms toilet
(http://www.tbfenvironmental.in/) uses tiger worms to degrade waste into
compost. There are also these two-pit composting toilets
(https://www.sulabhinternational.org/sulabh-technologies/). These toilets are
also here in our home turf. In Boston, there is also a composting toilet company
(https://clivusmultrum.com/)

The question is: how can you tell when the compost is ready? Obviously, you can
keep on checking the feces turned compost or gain experience in telling when
it's ready. However, it would be much more convenient (and accurate) if there
were objective metrics to let you know if your compost is ready.

Thus, my idea is to integrate sensors, specifically a temperature sensor and a
sensor that detects methane levels, to tell the user if their compost is ready.

## Materials Used

thermistor, wires, power bank, 3D printer, mq-4 gas sensor, esp32

## Electronics

The premise of my electronics component is that I want to have my ESP32 act as
an accesspoint. This is especially important to have ESP32 act as an access
point rather than rely on an external router, because since the toilet can be in
more rural areas, there might not necessarily be a router nearby.

Most of my electronics and code building process can be found on my page for
week 9. To avoid repetition, and to make this page cleaner, I've linked it
[here](./09_wireless.mdx). Please check it out, since it's really neat stuff!

## Summary

Here is a big picture summary + overview of what happens (Again, please check
out my documentation for Week 9 for more detail)

1. First, I wired up my breadboard for the thermistor and make sure my
   temperature code is working
2. Them , I wired up my breadboard for the gas sensor and make sure my gas
   sensing code is working.
3. With each of these components underway, I then merged these components
   together and get the access point component to work.
4. I then had the code to essentially set up my ESP32 asthe access point, for
   instance putting in information like what I want to call my ESP32 access
   point and the password to login to the access point. I will also design the
   website to have three buttons. One will show if the gas levels indicate that
   the compost from the composting toilet is ready. One button will show if,
   overall, the compost is ready.
5. When I upload and run the accesspoint temperature + gas code on the Arduino,
   I got an IP address in the serial monitor
6. I then login-ed to the ESP32 network and type in the password
7. I then pressed the restart button on my Arduino, and watch as the website
   updates to see if my compost is ready.

Here is the breadboard I ultimately used

```

Ultimately, I get an interface that looks like this:
![compost_interface](../../public/09_wireless/compost_interface.png)

Again, check out my Week 9 documentation for more details!

The main things I changed is that since this needed to be portable, I made sure
that I was connecting to a rechargeable battery source rather than my laptop.

I will also detail more changes I made in the Assembly section below since the
other changes came up once I started assembling it with my dry box.

## Dry Box

I wanted to have a dry box for my electronics. After all, my electronics would
be in a composting pit. Thus, I wanted the electronics (breadboard, wires,
ESP32, battery, etc) to be dry. Thus, I decided to make a box that I could use
to easily access the ESP32 and electronics but also would have a lid to close
it. Moreover, I wanted it to look like a toilet tank.

To do this, I first looked at this link Autodesk gallery link
(https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/39953/box-w-hinges), which
features a box with hinges. It wasn't exactly what I wanted but it has hinges so
I thought it would be a good starting point.

Hence, I decided to adapt it. I looked into the history of how the file was made
to change the dimensions, make additional extrusions, make it what I need it to
be.

I first needed to make sure that the box could fit everything. It needed to fit
all the electronics and also the rechargeable battery source. Thus, using a
caliper, I determined that I wanted the box to be 150 mm(length) X 70 mm (depth)
X 85 mm (height).

I went to the history of the box of the autodesk file and began editing the
dimsensions of the sketch. I changed both the dimensions of the lid, as well as
the main box. To note, I used the colinear tool beccause I wanted to maintain
the hinges in the middle. I also used different tools like the midpoint
constrain tools. Thus, I changed the dimensions and used the colinear tool to
ensure that the center is maintained.

![final_project](../../public/final_project/colinear-tool.png)
![final_project](../../public/final_project/midpoint.png)

As part of my design, I wanted a lip to say "Composting toilet monitor" to stand
out. Hence, I decided to take the existing structure and then extrude to the
depth that I need the box to be (hence, so the total height is 85 mm). Hence,
since the lip is 20 mm, I extruded the base of the box by another 65 mm.

I then cut the hole of the box. Specifically, I used the extrusion tool from the
top view to cut a rectangle 66.68 mm X 146.80 mm inwards for 60mm.

![final_project](../../public/final_project/cut.png)

I then made the slots for the thermistor and the gas sensor. I first measured
the dimensions. I wanted the thermistor to be able to fit into a hole. Thus, I
made the hole to be 4mm in diameter.

![final_project](../../public/final_project/dimensioning-slot.png)

I also wanted to have rectanglular hole that is slightly smaller than the space
of the 4 different input wires, so I could glue the female end on the inside of
the box and have the gas sensor be able to pox through the rectangular hole
straight into the female ends of the wires. Hence, I made this a 2.6 X 10.6 mm
rectangle

To position where the holes should be I modeled them by stretching across the
thermistor and the gas sensor and measured how far it was away from the bottom
of the breadboard. I determined that the thermistor should be 9.53 mm above
ground, 21 mm from the left side. The rectangular hole for the gas sensor wires
should have the line of the rectangle closest to the bottom be 9.5 mm away and
8.762 mm away from the hole for the thermositer.

![final_project](../../public/final_project/slots.png)

Lastly, I decided to make an indent of the words "compost toilet monitor." That
way, if someone sees my monitor in a compost pit, they'd know what it's for. It
looks like this!

![final_project](../../public/final_project/label.png)

Here is the final CAD file (click
[here](../../public/final_project/compost_toilet_monitor_box.stl) to download!

![compost toilet](../../public/final_project/compost_toilet_stl_file.png)

After 3D printing it, I used pliers to yank out the support structure. This is
all the stuff I yanked out!

![final_project](../../public/final_project/yanked_out.jpg)

## Assembling the different parts together

Because I was in isolation due to COVID, my soldering composed of twisting the
wires together and using the hot glue in my room to secure the wires together.

![final_project](../../public/final_project/thermistor-solder-1.jpg)
![final_project](../../public/final_project/thermistor-solder-2.jpg)

I first placed my breadboard, complete with everything plugged in, into my box.
Yay it fits! I then secured the female end of the wires for the gas sensors
using glue and to ensure that it would secured tight enough for the gas sensor
to easily plug into it.

![final_project](../../public/final_project/gas-wires.jpg)

I then plugged in my gas sensor and ensured it fit in well. For maximum
security, I also glued down the gas sensor with a dab of hot glue, but this is
optional, especially if you want a design that's more modular.

I then "soldered" (aka twisted and hot-glued in my room) the wires to the
thermistor. That way, I can reach the hole designed for the thermistor from my
breadboard

Here is what it looked like at the end!

![final_project](../../public/final_project/front.jpg)
![final_project](../../public/final_project/top.jpg)
![final_project](../../public/final_project/back.jpg)
![final_project](../../public/final_project/side.jpg)

It worked!!! I was able to get the correct interface when I ran it :) (again, I
set 30 degrees C as the cutoff for the temp and 800 units for the gas level and
was going to change it once I was out of quarantine and had the opportunity to
test with real compost. For now, it is a proof of concept)

![final_project](../../public/final_project/final-interface.png)

It even looks like a toilet tank!

## Future directions

- Originally, I was also going to integrate a pH sensor, but it did not
  arrive--no worries-- and hence would be a good future direction. Although, pH
  sensors are super finnicky and hard to work with ( and better to use in
  liquid), so I'm not sure if I would actually use it.
- Since I was in isolation, I was unable to test my device on actual compost and
  provide the precise cutoff values for what temperature and methane level
  indicates that the compost is ready. Before I got COVID, I was planning to go
  to nearby compost pits and see what the temperature and methane level value
  is. Hence, actually testing the device and getting these values would be
  important.
- I would also like to fix the tolerance issue to make the gap between the lid
  and the box tighter. Moreover, I would also make the clasp tighter and less
  thin.

## Reflections

Overall, I'm really happy with the way this project turned out! I've learned a
lot throughout the process, such as how to set up an ESP32 to be an access
point.
