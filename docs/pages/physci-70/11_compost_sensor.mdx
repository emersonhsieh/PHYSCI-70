# Week 11: Computer Programming

## Background

For this week's project, I'm using Firebase to give a visual display of if your
compost is ready.

I was inspired by the app "Is it dark outside," which is an ironic app that
literally tells you if it's dark outside. It's the only thing the app does.

I too, wanted to make a very simple interface much like "is it dark outside"
that will tell you if your compost is ready. Hence, it's called "is your compost
ready?" and will take input from a thermosister and display a red square if

Although I plan on using my ESP32 for my final project as the access point, I
wanted to explore how to use Firebase, which relies on a router with internet
access.

I'm super interested in toilets, and one of the ways in which toilets are made
more accessible in some parts of the world to people who do not have
comprehensive sewer systems is through the creation of compost toilets.
Essentially, it's a toilet that turns waste to compost without additional energy
or water input.

I wanted to use a monitor that could use sensors to tell you if the compost is
ready or not. For this week's project, I wanted specifically to have temperature
as the input. After all, compost warms up when it is ready.

Hence, for some places where there is nearby router access, this may be a viable
option in lieu of my final project setup where the ESP32 acts as an access
point.

## Arduino code and Breadboard (Input)

I set up my breadboard to have a thermosister. Thus, temperature could be an
input. I've worked on running and calibrated the thermositer in a previous week
(see electronic input week)

Here is a picture of my breadboard. I simplified some of the wiring for this
week and tested it out. I know it works because there is the expected
temperature written out on the serial monitor and serial plotter when I run the
code!

![week 11 breadboard](../../public/11_compost_sensor/week_11_breadboard.jpg)

Below is my code. In the first part of the code, I set up the Arduino software
to connect with Firebase. I was able to get information like the Firebase_host
after I set up a Firebase account and created a project specifically for the
composting toilet. The Random Nerd Tutorials Website I linked above goes through
how to set up a project.

I referenced the LED code on Nathan's website (linked the resources header
above) for the parts that I needed to plug in the information of my Firebase and
Wifi. I also made sure to have the Firebase library and Wifi library installed.

I then decided to only include Celsius (unlike prior to week 6, where there were
different units like Kelvin and Farenheit and corresponding plots) for the
temperature.

I wrote in an if statement for my temperature code. That way, it knows to tell
Firebase that the compost is not ready if the temperature is below 25C. However,
if the temperature is above 25C, it tells Firebase that the compost is ready.
For future reference, Rob also has a temperature code on his website that could
also be adapted in
(https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/Thermistor/thermistor_read.txt)
to work on Firebase.

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(1000);
  WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD);                          // try to connect with wifi
  TE = 0;
  TI = 25 + 273.15;                 //Temperature T0 from datasheet, conversion from Celsius to kelvin

  Serial.print("Connecting to ");
  Serial.print(WIFI_SSID);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.print(".");
    delay(500);
  }

  Serial.println();
  Serial.print("Connected to ");
  Serial.println(WIFI_SSID);
  Serial.print("IP Address is : ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());                                // print local IP address
  Firebase.begin(FIREBASE_HOST, FIREBASE_AUTH);                  // connect to firebase
  Firebase.reconnectWiFi(true);
  Firebase.set(firebaseData, "/TEMP_STATUS", "NOT READY");              // set initial string of "OFF"
}

void loop() {

  Firebase.get(firebaseData, "/TEMP_STATUS");                     // get input from firebase
  fireString = firebaseData.stringData();                        // change to e.g. intData() or boolData()
  Serial.println(fireString);


  VRT = analogRead(A0);              //Acquisition analog value of VRT
  VRT = (5.00 / 1023.00) * VRT;      //Conversion to voltage
  VR = VCC - VRT;
  RT = VRT / (VR / R);               //Resistance of RT

  ln = log(RT / RT0);
  TE = (1 / ((ln / B) + (1 / TI))); //Temperature from thermistor

  TE = TE - 273.15 -11;                 //Conversion to Celsius
  // Serial.println(TE) //used for debugging and verification of temp

  if (TE> 25) {
     Firebase.setString(firebaseData,"/TEMP_STATUS", "ready");
  }
  else {
     Firebase.set(firebaseData,"/TEMP_STATUS", "not ready");
  }

  delay(1000);                                 // not strictly necessary
}

```

To note, I had to use the Makerspace Wifi since it has less security, which
allows this to work.

This then feeds it into the Firebase database, which I'll detail below.

## Firebase

I set up my Firebase by following the instructions on Nathan's Website Nathan's
website on firebase:
https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/10_networking/huzzah1b.html

Random nerd tutorials is also useful as another way to explain it:
https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-firebase-gauges-charts/

I was able to make my composting toilet firebase working! :)

![composting_toilet_firebase](../../public/11_compost_sensor/composting_toilet_firebase.png)

This is what the Realtime database looks like

![real time database](../../public/11_compost_sensor/realtime_database_what_it_looks_like.png)

Based on the temperature and the Arduino code I showed above, it either states
that the Temp_status is ready or not ready.

Hence, right now, since the temperature is not >25 degrees Celsius, it says "not
ready" (As verified by my thermometer, which says the temperature is less than
25 degrees + serial monitor when I put in a line of code so that my serial
monitor displays the temperature).

When I moved my thermosister closer to my heater and put my finger over it as
well, it became >25 and changed it to "ready." This is as confirmed when I
uncomment a line of code so that my serial monitor displays the temperature.

## HTML Interface

This is the code I had worked on (Shoutout to Kassia for helping!!). (It's
screenshots of it because my HTML got mad at me that I was pasting in HTML code,
and the codetags wouldn't work for). I made arrows and white boxes to emphasize
the essential components of the HTML code.

![html code](../../public/11_compost_sensor/html-code-1-green-square.png)
![html code](../../public/11_compost_sensor/html-code-2-green-square.png)

When Firebase displays "not ready", it displays a red square

![not ready](../../public/11_compost_sensor/not_ready.png)
![red square](../../public/11_compost_sensor/red_square.png)

When the Firebase displays "ready", the html website displays a green square.

![ready](../../public/11_compost_sensor/ready.png)
![green square](../../public/11_compost_sensor/green_square.png)

Altogether, when the thermosister reads the temperature is more than 25 degrees
C, the arduino code tells Firebase to display "ready". This then makes the
square turn green. When the thermosister reads the temperature is less than 25
degrees C, the arduino code tells Firebase to display " not ready". This then
makes the square turn red.

## Variations + notes

I also spent some time trying out different sizes of boxes. For instance,
originally, I had the box much smaller, but realized it was hard to show around
during show and tell Hence, I altered the HTML code to make it a 500 x 500 sized
square rather than 100 X 100 Here's what the dimensions of the box looked like
before

![dimensions_of_box](../../public/11_compost_sensor/dimensions_of_box.png)

Moreover, when I was trying to debug with Kassia, we communicated via Slack. She
kept on saying the code worked for her but it didn't work on my computer. Turns
out there are these ghost numbers, presumably that appeared when I copied a
debugged code from Slack. (notice the _0X200b_ in gray)

![grayedout](../../public/11_compost_sensor/grayedout.png)

Also, to note, in my original temperature code from previous weeks, I had used
the variables TX and TI to indiciate the temperature and the initial temperature
respectively. However, it seems to coincide with some other variable names in
ESP32 or the wifi communication process. Thus, I got a lot of error messages and
had to change it to TE and T0 respectively.

## Reflections

Ultimately, I'm super happy with the result. I like it seeing it change from a
red square to a green square depending on the given temperature. It's simple,
just like "Is it Dark Outside :)"
